NODE JS:
Open source server environment, allows to run JavaScript on the server.
Server-side script to develop the scalable web application.


FEATURE:
Asynchronounus & Data driven
Single thread application
Nodejs scripting code runs Google Chrome v8 Engine
 

CONNECT THE SERVER:
Install the http npm package and connect the localhost server
var http = require('http');
 
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
 res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
 res.end('Hello World!');
}).listen(8080);
 
 
EXPRESS JS
Is a web application framework, that provides to create api to build the websites
Providing a structural approach to managing server-side logic.

// Import express
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, Express!');
});

app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
  res.send('About Page');
});

// Start the server and listen on port 3000
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});
 
 
WHY EXPRESS JS
Simplicity: less code and simple code
Flexibility: can build more modules
Scalability: can build wild range project
Community supports: large & active community
 
 
CORS: - Cross Origin Resource Sharing
Allows or restricts which domain can access your api.
Helps to secure the application to access which resource can be it.
 
 
ROUTES:
Allow to user to navigate to specific url
 
 
MIDDLEWARE:
User-defined function that has each requests passes through before reaching the routes, and intercept of request, run the code and decide what to do next.
 
 
EsLint:
Automatically detecting incorrect patterns found in javascript code
 
 
Test pyramid:
Three types: Unit testing, Integration Testing, End-to-end test
 
 
Scaffolding:
To generating basic structure of project


ADVANTAGES:
Asynchronounus, Data driven
Scalability - Asynchronounus allow to build large concurrent connections efficiently,
Fast execution - Nodejs runs on Chrome v8 Engine

DISADVANTAGES:
Callback hell -
Signle thread process - can not handle the heavy operations
Debug is difficult -


MICROSERVICE:
Collection small independent service connecting with other service

MACROSERVICE:
Entire application built as a single, unified unit
Titly connected with interagrated and component


BUFFER:
Perform an action in raw binary data, memory location in memory


STREAMS:
Type of data handling method, read & write inputs into output sequentially.


CRYPTO:
Encrypt and decrypt data, for the the data secure, creating hash value


CALLBACK HELL:
Nested Callback process, resolve by promise method


HEADERS:
Authorization: bearer API KEY
'Content-Type': 'application/json' , multipart/form-data' , 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
'Accept' : 'application/json' , 'application/xml'
'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36'
'Cookie': 'sessionid=your-session-id'
'Cache-Control': 'no-cache'
'Origin': 'https://your-website.com'


What is the Event Loop?
The event loop is a core concept in Node.js that helps the server handle multiple tasks simultaneously, 
even though it's running on a single thread. It does this by managing and executing asynchronous operations 
(like reading files, database calls, etc.) efficiently.

REACTJS:
Open-source JavaScript Library
using to build Single page application


JSX:
JavaScript XML, allow to write HTML code to Javascript render DOM.


VIRTUAL DOM:
keeps lightweight a representation of real dom in memory, called Virtual DOM.
Virual DOM changes only in real DOM rather than updating all objects


UNIDIRECTIONAL & BIDIRECTIONAL:
Unidirectional - one way communication, parent component to child component
Birectional - two way communication, between of parent & child component


ADVANTAGES & DISADVANTAGES:
Advantage: 
    component based architecture - reusable components
    Virtual DOM - keeps a lightweight representation of real DOM in memory
    JSX - Javascript XML


Disadvantage:
    high pace developement - continues to updates from React.js, so developer not comfortable to relearn
    poor documentation - not providing proper documentation for the new updates & acceleratings
    JSX - very hard to manage the HTML & Javascript codes in one place


FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT:
Lifecycle - Statless component
Shorter syntax - easy to write, small component
Hooks - use hooks concepts to UseState, UseEffect to get the data, update etc..


CLASS COMPONENT:
Lifecycle - Stateful component, internal state & have Lifecycle methods like 
    componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, ComponentWillMount
Verbose syntax - has large code, requiring to use constructor & render methods
